# Almost-Free-ML-AI-Guide

This Repo and the Course-Guide in PDF-format - are intended to guide you towards becoming a Data Science // Machine Learning // AI Engineering Professional.

There are plenty of platforms like Coursera, edX, Udemy, etc. who as of today even allow you to pursue a Master's Degree in all these fields.

Despite all good intentions and valueable credit of all participating institutions - it still might be an expensive route for many people across the globe.

As yearly tuition fees can easily hit the 10K/20K/50K barrier - this guide tries to give you some guidance to acquire comperable knowledge for less cost.

Nevertheless i have to admit that I am biased - as I personally perferred the Coursera-Platform - which is often mentioned on the guide.

The idea is: you get yourself an annual subscription on this platform (often a nice discount is offered) and try to accomplish as many courses as possible.

Depending on your previous knowledge - you might start not on the Beginner Level, which is recommended for people without proper math and IT skills.

On the Intermediate and Advanced Level you can choose one of the listed courses. 

As personal preferences might be different - some people like one course  - the others don't. So make your choice or take them all ;-).

All of these courses are suitable to tackle the "Professional" level courses later.
